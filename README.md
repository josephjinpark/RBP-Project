# RBP-Project
RNA-binding proteins in cancers

Project from 2016-2017 @ Seoul National University.
Coded by me with big help from Sukjun Kim, https://github.com/dandyrilla



Leverages RBP-Transcriptome interactions using AGO-CLIP/eCLIP datasets from ENCODE.
Determines whether the binding sites +/ flanking region serve as potential mutational hotspots in various cancers using the TCGA database.
